# Open Source Training plans for PHP.

Welcome to my open source training plan ðŸš€

I created this to help others who are trying to get into PHP and Laravel development but are struggling to find the information they need, or they're overwhelmed with what's out there and not sure which way to go.

Please see the available training plans below:

- [PHP Training Plan](./training/php)
- [Laravel Training Plan](./training/frameworks/laravel)


## Contributions

All and any contributions are welcome, however these will be checked over in a PR process to ensure that they are in face training materials and not just opportunities to sell products/services and are not spam. This is a training plan, not a marketing exercies.

If you wish to submit a new training plan for a framework not provided, please make sure to follow the conventions already set out and use the [template provided](./training/TEMPLATE.md) to structure your training plan. 

If you wish to submit a training plan on something that isn't a framework, please propose a structure in an issue before submitting a PR so that these can be checked to ensure they are logic and follow the overall aims of this project.
